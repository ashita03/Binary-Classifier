# Binary-Classifier
Created a Binary Classifier to categorise whether a request is safe or not

:pushpin: **PROBLEM STATEMENT**

Lets assume you are part of the team developing cyber security product. This product protects web and mobile applications from runtime attacks. The way hackers attack keeps on changing constantly and that's where Machine Learning comes into the picture. Your task is to develop machine learning model which can identify if the request is safe or not.

:open_file_folder: The data is taken from: https://www.google.com/url?q=https://jsonblob.com/f0b70eef-566b-11eb-9d92-415b3ac53928&sa=D&ust=1610730944924000&usg=AFQjCNFmZgpU_yyINJuQF1EDdZDkZDMhWw
(which is provided as a sample data).
I saved this data in a .json file which is used in the notebook. The file is shared in this repository.

:pencil2:The two approaches made to solve this problem statement were:
